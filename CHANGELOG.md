### NuttX platform port — (Linux sim, CI-gated)

- `platform/nuttx/` is fully implemented — every `Platform*` symbol has a working body with no `-ENOSYS` stubs remaining. Covers: pthreads wapp lifecycle, `opendir`/`readdir`/`qsort` registry (no scandir/VLA), NuttX VFS driver, `clock_gettime`/`clock_nanosleep`, `/dev/urandom` random, BSD sockets (TLS not supported), `wanted_main` built-in app entry point, pthread mutex.
- The NuttX sim (host-stack `sim:wanted` defconfig) is a first-class build target: `make nuttx-{deps,build,smoke,selftest,shell}`. NuttX + apps forks vendored as shallow submodules at `third_party/`.
- `nuttx-integration-tests` CI job builds the engine as a NuttX built-in and runs `smoke-engine` + selftest on the sim.
- Two NuttX-specific bugs fixed: `CONFIG_INTERPRETERS_WAMR_THREAD_MGR` required for `wasm_runtime_terminate` to have effect; `pthread_cleanup_push/pop` is a no-op without `CONFIG_PTHREAD_CLEANUP` — wapp reaping now calls `WA_threadEnd` directly.
- `wanted_sim_main` calls `boardctl(BOARDIOC_POWEROFF)` after `wanted_main` returns so the sim exits cleanly.

### In-WASM selftest suite

- Added a `selftest` supervisor variant (`wapps/selftest/`) that orchestrates the full test suite from inside WASM. Runs identically on Linux and the NuttX sim via `make selftest` / `make nuttx-selftest`; output is TAP.
- 29 test scenarios across VFS/namespace, inter-wapp IPC, concurrency/stop, and negative/robustness categories.
- Shell smoke scripts (`smoke.sh`, `smoke-multiwapp.sh`, `smoke-pipe.sh`, `smoke-driver.sh`) retired in favour of the in-WASM suite. `smoke-engine.sh` kept for production-supervisor sanity.

### Engine — log console driver

- Added a per-wapp log console driver (`src/vfs/vfs-log.c` + `src/log-store.c`): a ring-buffer store captures a wapp's stdout/stderr and exposes it at `/dev/wanted/wapps/<name>/log`. Wapps configured with `console:log` no longer share the platform console; the supervisor reads their output via the control plane. LRU eviction when all name slots are full.
- `debug_trace` now emits via a raw `write()` syscall so it reaches the console on every target.

### Engine — supervisor priority and interruptible stop

- Supervisor thread is created one priority step above worker threads on both Linux and NuttX; worker priorities are set explicitly to prevent inheritance.
- Added interruptible stop on NuttX: `PlatformWappStop` sends `SIGUSR2` to the worker after `WantedWappTerminate` so a wapp blocked in a host syscall is interrupted and the stop flag checked on return. A per-worker `interrupted` flag bridges `clock_nanosleep`'s success-on-signal quirk. Linux retains `pthread_cancel(ASYNCHRONOUS)`.

### Test baseline

- ctest: **52/52** (one wsh-smoke ctest retired alongside the shell scripts).
- selftest: **29/29** on Linux and the NuttX sim.
- `smoke-engine.sh`: green on Linux; run on the NuttX sim via `nuttx-sim.sh`.

0.6.0 (2026-06-04)
------------------

### Named pipes — inter-wapp IPC (breaking internal change)

- Promoted `/dev/pipe/<name>` from per-wapp scratch storage to a process-wide inter-wapp channel. The engine owns one shared `pipe_store_t` (lazily created on the supervisor's thread); every wapp's pipe driver references it, so a pipe opened in one wapp is visible in another. Previously each wapp got an independent ring buffer and pipes could not cross the boundary.
- Reads now **block** by default: with no data and a writer attached (or none yet seen) the read sleeps and retries instead of returning `EAGAIN`. `O_NONBLOCK` restores the non-blocking behaviour; a safety cap bounds the wait. EOF (`0`) is returned only once a writer has attached and all writers have closed (`writer_seen`). The blocking wait sleeps unlocked, so async thread cancellation cannot strand the lock.
- All shared-store access is guarded by a new platform mutex primitive (`PlatformMutexNew/Lock/Unlock/Free`): pthread-backed on linux, no-op on the single-threaded dummy.
- `_bDestroy` now closes a wapp's still-open pipe handles (decrementing the shared refcounts) before freeing its handle table, so an exiting writer no longer leaks its `writers` count and readers in other wapps reach EOF.
- `PipeDriverCreate()` takes a `pipe_store_t *`; added `PipeStoreNew()`/`PipeStoreFree()`.
- Fixed a pre-existing preopen bug surfaced by the test: `_OpenAt` joined the relative path against `rootPath` via `cwk_path_change_root`, which dropped the separator (`"/dir" + "file"` → `"/dirfile"`), so a launched wapp could never create a file in a preopen subdirectory. It now `openat()`s the path directly against the preopen directory fd.
- Extended `wapps/hello/` with `reader`/`writer` roles read from `/etc/role` in the wapp's own rootfs (each smoke image bakes its role there); added `test/smoke-pipe.sh` and `make smoke-pipe`, which exchange a payload between two `hello` instances through one named pipe and assert delivery via a host result file. Added an inter-driver `pipe_shared` unit-test group.

### Control plane — per-wapp namespace decomposition (breaking)

- Replaced the single multiplexed `/dev/wanted/ctrl` JSON-RPC node with a path-addressed per-wapp namespace under `/dev/wanted/wapps/` plus a root `/dev/wanted/ctl` create-and-launch node.
- `wapps/` enumerates known wapps (`ReadDir`); each `wapps/<name>/` exposes plain-text read nodes `state`, `version`, `id` and write nodes `ctl` (line verb `start`/`stop`) and `config` (JSON `{ console, drivers[], preopens }`). Wapp identity travels in the path, not a payload field.
- Root `ctl` accepts `start <name>` as a create-and-launch shorthand, applying any config previously buffered at `wapps/<name>/config`.
- Removed the legacy `WantedControlDriver`, its `w/ctrl` alias, and the now-unused `WantedReadState`/`StateToJson` all-wapps JSON blob. `w/reg` is retained for the supervisor binary.
- Hardened the parse path: bounded on-stack JSON buffers (`WANTED_CTRL_JSON_MAX`) instead of variable-length arrays; per-fd read EOF state so concurrent readers keep independent cursors; oversized control writes rejected with `EMSGSIZE`.
- Added a controllable in-memory wapp-state mock to the dummy platform (`DummyWappStateSeed`/`DummyWappStateReset`).

### Control plane — multi-wapp launch lifecycle fixes

- Fixed a use-after-free on the control-plane start path: `StartWapp()` freed the `wapp_t` immediately after `PlatformWappStart()` while the just-spawned worker thread still dereferenced it (manifesting as a garbled wapp name stuck at `not_started`). Ownership now transfers to the platform thread slot and is released when that slot is later reused; the persistent supervisor image is never freed. The error path also unmaps the wapp image before freeing the struct.
- Fixed a teardown segfault during supervisor respawn: worker threads called `wasm_runtime_init_thread_env()` but never the matching destroy, leaving the stack guard pages mprotect'd `PROT_NONE` on a detached thread's (later glibc-reused) stack — the next worker's `init_thread_env` faulted touching them. `WantedWappStop()` now calls `wasm_runtime_destroy_thread_env()` on every worker exit (success or failure), restoring the guard pages and freeing the signal alternate stack.

### Tooling — sample wapp + multi-wapp smoke test

- Added `wapps/hello/` — a minimal WASI sample wapp (source, manifest, Makefile) used to exercise concurrent multi-wapp execution through wsh.
- Added `test/smoke-multiwapp.sh` — packages the sample into the registry (`REGISTRY_ROOT`), drives wsh to write a launch config and `start` the wapp, then asserts `status` reports it running alongside the supervisor.
- Added `make wapps` (compile sample wapp images) and `make smoke-multiwapp` targets.

0.5.0 (2026-05-19)
------------------

### WebAssembly runtime — WAMR migration (breaking internal change)

- Replaced `wasm3` with **WAMR 2.4.4** (BytecodeAlliance) in classic interpreted mode (`WAMR_BUILD_INTERP=1`, `WAMR_BUILD_AOT=0`, `WAMR_BUILD_LIBC_WASI=0`).
- WAMR vendored as a git submodule at `vendor/wamr` pinned to tag `WAMR-2.4.4`.
- `platform/esp-idf` removed; `platform/nuttx/` stub added as the target embedded platform skeleton.
- `src/CMakeLists.txt` rewritten: `runtime_lib.cmake` consumed to populate `WAMR_RUNTIME_LIB_SOURCE`; `vmlib` static target created explicitly.
- Full wapp lifecycle ported: `wasm_runtime_full_init` → `wasm_runtime_load` → `wasm_runtime_instantiate` → `wasm_runtime_create_exec_env` → `wasm_runtime_call_wasm` → teardown via `wasm_runtime_destroy_exec_env` / `wasm_runtime_deinstantiate` / `wasm_runtime_unload`.
- Native host functions registered via `NativeSymbol` arrays and `wasm_runtime_register_natives` (replaces `m3_LinkRawFunctionEx`).
- Runtime init extracted into `EnsureWamrInit()` — idempotent, called from both `WantedStart` and `WantedWappRun` so unit tests that bypass `WantedStart` initialise correctly.
- Per-thread signal environment (`wasm_runtime_init_thread_env()`) wired into every worker entry point — required by WAMR's hardware bounds-check trap handler.
- `wasm_runtime_load` mutates its input buffer (LEB128 patching); engine keeps a heap-owned writable copy (`wamrData_t.wasm_bytes`) freed after `wasm_runtime_unload`.
- `proc_exit` modelled as `wasm_runtime_set_exception(inst, "proc_exit")`; `wanted.c` distinguishes clean exit from runtime errors via `strcmp`.
- `lookup_function` API drop in WAMR 2.x: third (signature) argument removed.

### WASI bridge rewrite

- `wasi-vfs.c` fully rewritten to WAMR `NativeSymbol` conventions (~700 lines).
- All 24 WASI snapshot-preview1 handlers ported; shared `vaddr()` helper validates wasm linear-memory addresses via `wasm_runtime_validate_app_addr` and translates them with `wasm_runtime_addr_app_to_native`.
- Local `wasi_types.h` added (`src/wasi/`) — vendors the snapshot-preview1 type definitions and constants (`__wasi_fdstat_t`, `__wasi_filestat_t`, `__wasi_subscription_t`, errno codes, rights flags) because `WAMR_BUILD_LIBC_WASI=0` excludes WAMR's own WASI headers.
- Both `wasi_unstable` and `wasi_snapshot_preview1` namespaces registered from the same `NativeSymbol` table.

### TarFS — OCI-layered filesystem (new subsystem)

- `wapp_t` refactored to carry an OCI layer stack instead of a single blob pointer.
- OCI layered TAR parser added with PSRAM-friendly index (`vfs/tarfs`): O(log N) path lookup, boot-time pre-fetch, whiteout (`.wh.`) semantics for layer shadowing.
- PAX extended headers and GNU long-name entries supported — required for OCI-exported images with paths > 100 bytes.
- Phase 5 file and directory operations implemented (`VfsOpen`, `VfsStat`, `VfsReaddir` via TarFS).
- End-to-end `VfsOpen` coverage added (Phase 7 test).
- Wapp boot wired through TarFS entrypoints; per-wapp `tarfs_ctx_t` lifetime owned by the engine.
- Legacy `fildes`/romfs dispatch path retired.

### Supervisor — TAR image loading

- Supervisor loaded from a ustar TAR archive at runtime (`PlatformWappLoad`) instead of being compiled into the binary.
- Default supervisor variant renamed to **sheriff**; `wsh` debug shell remains as an alternative.
- `supervisor.imagePath` JSON config field added — runtime override requires no recompile; resolved before the compiled-in `WANTED_SUPERVISOR_IMAGE_PATH` CMake default.
- Fix: sheriff supervisor boot failure caused by stale config/path stack state on startup.

### VFS — router, DevFS, NetFS, and fixes

- Stateless prefix router added; `DevFs` and `NetFs` collapsed onto direct registration (no shim layer).
- Typed FD table scaffolded on `vfs_ctx_t`; `vfs_fd_t.path` carries the resolved path for relative operations across namespace boundaries.
- `PathNormalize` replaced with `cwk_path_normalize` (cwalk library) — handles `..`, `.`, double-slash correctly.
- Mount-table VFS router replaces hardcoded prefix chain; `PathNormalize` + `VfsResolvePath` for namespace-boundary resolution.
- ProcFS (`/proc`) — read-only flat namespace; privileged-entry access control; `/proc/wapps`, `/proc/memory`.
- Named pipes (`/dev/pipe/<name>`) — 4096-byte ring buffer; up to 8 concurrent pipes; write→close→read lifecycle.
- Stdio stub devices (`/dev/null`, `/dev/stdin`, `/dev/stdout`, `/dev/stderr`) always registered.
- `system.privileged` config flag; `VfsSetPrivileged()` public API.
- Fix: error propagation from `route_open` (M1/M3), `DevFs_Open`, and `NetFs_Open` — driver errno codes now surface to callers.
- Fix: `devfs` readdir returning stale entries.

### Manifest

- `requirements` field added to `manifest.json` schema — parsed by `WantedWappParseManifestBytes` and stored in `wapp_t`; Sheriff validates capabilities before issuing start actions.
- `requirements[]` added to both `sheriff` and `wsh` supervisor manifests.

### wsh

- v0.4.1: fix `ls` path resolution — `lstat` was called with a relative path that broke directory listings outside the working directory.

### CLI and tooling

- Executable target renamed from `wanted_cmd` to `wanted-cli`.
- Devcontainer configuration added for VS Code / JetBrains remote development.
- Source tree reformatted to LLVM coding style; `.clang-format` and IDE helper files added.
- Smoke test suite added (`test/smoke.sh`, wsh-based, 16 tests).

### Test baseline

- 20/20 ctest, 16/16 smoke tests pass on the `wamr` branch.
